# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

This is an end-to-end machine learning project that aims to predict the test scores of students based on several variables such as gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and test preparation course. The project is built using Python and several popular machine learning libraries, including scikit-learn and pandas.

## Problem Statement

The project aims to answer the following question: How are the test scores of students affected by other variables such as gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and test preparation course? The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the test scores of students based on these variables.

## Project Overview

The project follows the standard machine learning project lifecycle, which includes the following steps:

1. Understanding the Problem Statement: In this step, we define the problem statement and identify the variables that are relevant for predicting the test scores of students.

2. Data Collection: In this step, we collect the dataset that contains information about the test scores of students and the other relevant variables.

3. Data Checks: In this step, we perform several data checks to ensure that the dataset is clean, complete, and consistent.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis: In this step, we explore the dataset using various visualization and statistical techniques to gain insights into the data.

5. Data Pre-Processing: In this step, we preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the data.

6. Model Training: In this step, we train several machine learning models on the preprocessed data and evaluate their performance using various metrics.

7. Model Selection: In this step, we select the best machine learning model that provides the highest accuracy in predicting the test scores of students.
